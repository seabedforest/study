Government has developed a microcircuit that not only\\n   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust\\n   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of\\n   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.

Of course it didn\\'t have the initial power\\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \\nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \\nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn\\'t save the gears!\\n\\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\\ndo a \"stoppy\"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \\nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don\\'t recommend these\\nactivities anymore (now that I\\'m an \"old guy\" with kids of my own) but\\nit looked damn impressive!!\\n\\n  If you can\\'t keep both tires on the ground, at least have \\'em pointed\\nin that direction! :-)\\n\\nCheers, \\nB**2\\n',\n",

I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't\\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\\n>\\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\\n\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\\n\\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

This could be substantially\\nthe same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the\\npolice could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-\\nissued warrant).

Then replace \"prince\" with\\n\"government\" or \"president\", as appropriate, and read it again.  \\n\\n[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by\\nDaniel Donno.]\\n\\n\\tIn order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\\ndisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\\ncities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\\nthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\\ninitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\\ndestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\\njudgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\\ncircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\\nnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\\nwill allow.\\n\\n\\tTo begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\\ndisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\\nproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\\narms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\\nwhile those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\\nare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\\nnonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\\nextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\\nthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\\nthe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\\nand dangers should receive advantages.  \\n\\n\\tWhen you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\\nshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\\ndistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\\nMoreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\\nhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\\ndiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\\ngood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\\nsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\\nstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\\nfull of examples proving that this is so.\\n\\n\\tBut when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\\nannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\\nthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\\nit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\\nsoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\\nthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\\nhis original domain.\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\n\\tAnd since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind\\nany prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants\\nthat he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the\\nreason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction\\nwith the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to\\nkeep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he\\nwill carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn\\nfrom ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much\\neasier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former\\ngovernment, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of\\nthose who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to\\nreplace it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

That is, ignoring concerns about government\\nintrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to\\ninvestigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,\\nand their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  \\n\\nA rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million\\ndollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.

These projects failed to meet\\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \\ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \\ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\n\\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\nare spent on astronauts.\\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\n\\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\norbits.\\n\\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nNick Szabo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t szabo@techboook.com\\n\",\n",

The one most obviously\\napplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\\nspecify the \"similarity\" of matches in the data.\\n\\nFor example say you make up a password/phrase of \"qimwe7l\".\\nOf course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\\nin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\\nen entry that could be varied by some \"crack\" program to\\nbrute-force search for it?\\n\\nYou use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,\\none or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But \\n\\nagrep -3 \"qimwe7l\" bigwordandphraselist\\n\\nfinds that the pattern \"qimwe7l\" is too close to the\\npattern \"imsel\" (part of \"himself\" and a host of others),\\nto be of any cryptographic value as a key.\\n\\nAn error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of\\nletters like \"teh\" for \"the\".  A minimally acceptable password\\nwould have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately\\nruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.\\n(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at\\n*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)\\n\\n\\nAnd for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o\\'\\ntypos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,\\nsay I want to find out what people think about Gibson\\'s\\nSF book \"Neuromancer\" in the huge SF-Lover\\'s archives.\\nEven with an error distance specification as small as\\nof \"1\" I will find all those people who think the title\\nwas \"Necromancer\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?\\n\\nAlso, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL\\nat Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe\\nto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\\nreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\\n\\nYou can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\\nrandom three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\\ndon\\'t score the X chi-square \\'birthday\\' hits on message size Y.\\n\\nYou think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\\nthe pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find\\nNSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,\\nNational Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.\\n\\nYou can also specify \"fixed\" areas: looking for license\\nplate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,\\nyou might say:\\n\\nagrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase\\n\\nwill find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors\\n(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can\\nalso \"weight\" the relative \"cost\" for substiutions, additions,\\nor deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns\\nfor a particular protein combination, you might know that\\nsome kinds of damage cause the \"A\" nucelotide to drop out more\\nthan other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting\\n-Dc where you set the \"deletion cost\" to count as \"c\" errors.\\n\\nA steganographic use (I even used \"agrep -2 \"<steg>eograp\" E\"\\njust now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally\\nintroduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext\\nand then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of\\npossibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...\\n\\nAlso with agrep\\'s powerful extraction options it makes it easy\\nto abstract the \"hits\" into a useful form.  For example,\\n\\nagrep -d \"^From\" \\'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)\\'\\n\\nsays output the entire mail record, delimited by \\'From\\'\\nthat contains \\'PGP\\' and contains either \\'passphrase\\',\\n\\'Zimmerman\\', or \\'NSA\\'.\\n\\nAnd agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster\\nthan the second-best similarity tool publicly available.\\n\\nAs usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs\\nto those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do\\nan anonymous FTP.\\n\\nGet this now.\\nIt is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.\\n\\n\\nGrady Ward, vendor to the NSA (and proud of it)\\n\\n-- \\ngrady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F\\n\\n',\n",

NOw Otto\\'s latest debacle has restored Simmon\\'s\\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his \\'92 form when he had the\\nAL\\'s highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted\\'s sake), I hope he\\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\\n\\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year.

BUt I still think that\\nWalk desrved his contract.\\n\\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\\ncan\\'t understand his and management\\'s fear of losing Tom Prince through\\nwaivers. Even if they do, what\\'s the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching). Didn\\'t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won\\'t be as awful as he was in his last 2\\nstarts. BUt don\\'t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\\nthe season.

Metzger)\\nSubject: The Escrow Database.\\nOrganization: Partnership for an America Free Drug\\nLines: 77\\n\\nHere is a disturbing thought.\\n\\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\\n\\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\\n\\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\\'t put the whole\\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\\ndoubtless claim this can\\'t happen -- but we know that \"can\\'t\" is a\\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\\n\\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\\nevery person\\'s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\\n\\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\\nisn\\'t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\\nsecrets, so he isn\\'t being completely irrational here (although why\\nour companies couldn\\'t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \\n\\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\\nfraction of the keys. You can\\'t avoid that sort of thing.\\n\\nDon\\'t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\\nthe escrow databases.\\n\\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\\nsecret. The escrow databases aren\\'t the sorts of secrets that our\\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\\nClipper chips.\\n\\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\\ndoesn\\'t realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\\nthat they realize that they can\\'t put things off forever, but they can\\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\\n\\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\\nit all.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

Blowme)\\nSubject: new encryption\\nNntp-Posting-Host: rac3.wam.umd.edu\\nOrganization: University of Maryland, College Park\\nLines: 120\\n\\n   As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\\nTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\\nof this message on how to contact them).\\n\\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\\n\\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\\n\\n - A company of AT&T\\'s size could never be able to make a decision to use\\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\\n\\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T\\'s secure telephone\\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\\n\\n\\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\\n\\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\\n\\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\\n    of the government.\\n\\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\\n\\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\\n    changing the keys themselves.\\n\\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\\n\\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn\\'t tell\\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn\\'t been patented yet.\\nHowever he told me a little:\\n\\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\\n   secure.\\n\\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\\n   the following:\\n\\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\\n\\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\\n\\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\\n\\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\\n\\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\\n\\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\\n      hardware chip.\\n\\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\\n      enough, which probably won\\'t happen]).\\n\\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\\n\\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

It\\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\\nwhat you think.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER\\n----------\\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\\nother than one person\\'s opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\\nto a real lawyer.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\n---------------------\\n\\n1)  What is RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\\n the intended recipient.)\\n\\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n\\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\\n file:\\n\\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n\\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n RIPEM.\\n\\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\\n friend.\\n\\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\\n\\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n\\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n\\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n\\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n\\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n Emacs.\\n\\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\n5)  What is RSA?\\n\\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n\\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender\\'s private key.  The recipient can\\n use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\\n must have come from the sender.\\n\\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\\n\\n6)  What is DES?\\n\\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n\\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n\\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\\n multiple encryption with DES.\\n\\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\\n\\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n\\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n\\n8)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n\\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n\\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n None of them provide perfect security.\\n\\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n\\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people\\'s keys.\\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\\n same length, etc.\\n\\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n\\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n\\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n\\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n RFC 1321.\\n\\n11)  What is PGP?\\n\\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n\\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n\\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection.\\n\\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\\n   PGP 2.0.)\\n\\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP\\'s original\\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\\n\\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n   #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n   #contraband.  \\n\\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\\n   in Europe and other places.\\n\\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n\\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\\n shouldn\\'t be that way, and some people interpret various documents\\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n\\n12)  What about RPEM?\\n\\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\\n\\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n\\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n\\n13)  What is MIME?\\n\\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\\n the matter.\\n\\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\\n\\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and\\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is\\n probably key distribution.\\n',\n",

With integration,\\nyou could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they\\ncan be.\\n\\nYes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don\\'t need it from the government.\\nYou can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be\\ncompromised.

Were it not for\\nthe NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As\\nit is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been\\nfor them, I\\'m sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.\\n\\nThey aren\\'t the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones\\nkeeping cheap crypto out of people\\'s hands. When they hand you a\\nclipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize\\nfor having traded in your birthright.\\n\\nAnd what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from\\nforeigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else\\nand are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional\\nterrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on\\nthe open market that work just fine -- most of them can\\'t be idiots\\nlike the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper\\ncrypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that\\non its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.\\n\\nSomeone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in\\nexchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography?\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

Dunno how much it costs\\n    due to recent price increases, but I\\'d imagine over $400.\\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\\n\\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \\n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\\n    than upper Aerostich.\\n\\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \\nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i\\'d prefer a zip-out \\nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \\nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \\nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \\nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\\n\\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\\n\\nSteve\\n--\\n-- \\n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"\\n',\n",

But don\\'t forget that\\nZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB\\'s last year. Beware of\\nsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he\\'d\\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year.

Was\\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\\n                             this diagram\\n\\n\\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\\nname.\\n\\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\\nhistorians discount this story.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren\\'t sliding, you aren\\'t riding.\\n                                                                                                          \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

The\\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\\n        - Rechargable battery.\\n\\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don\\'t mind if I keep the 60 minute\\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\\n\\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he\\'s including an\\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n        I\\'m not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\\n\\n        Again, I\\'ve used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.

My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n        \\'nuff said.\\n\\n        The reason I\\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\\'t have any\\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\\'t.  (I am also paying more\\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\\n\\n        Of course, it has SCMS.

All they\\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\\nafter all IS the bottom line. \\n\\n\\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \\nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \\n\\n\\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \\nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\\n\\n\\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \\nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \\n\\n\\n\\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \\nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\\n\\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \\nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\\ndegree.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tSincerly,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tTim Scanlon\\n\\n-- \\n\\ntfs@gravity.gmu.edu\\n\",\n",

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which\\n    much of the net community has settled.

They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\\n    microfilm.\\n\\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\\'s vintage hardware (like\\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\\n    from.\\n\\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\\n    sheet design.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\\n\\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\\n    \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\\n    in a mission.\\n\\n\\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\\n\\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\\n\\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\\n    pursue are:\\n\\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good\\n    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo\\'s launch,\\n    \"Showdown at Pad 39-B,\" by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November\\n    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\n\\n    References:\\n\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\n\\n\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\n\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\\n    sci.astro.\\n\\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

(A ``block\\n  cipher\\'\\' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\\n\\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \\n  ciphers:\\n\\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\\n  DES               64                56                16\\n  LOKI              64                64                16\\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\\n  PES               64               128                 8\\n\\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\\n\\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\\n  cipher ``looks highly random\\'\\'. For example, the cipher must be\\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing\\'\\'\\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\\n\\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\\n\\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\\n\\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\\n\\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even\\'\\' permutations, i.e., all\\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\\n  of rounds.\\n\\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\\n\\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\\n\\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\\n  we say that E is a group.\\n\\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\\n\\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\\n\\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\\n\\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\\n  random boolean functions.\\n\\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\\n\\n  There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\\n  published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\\n\\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\\n  operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\\n\\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\\n\\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \\n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \\n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\\n  that were authenticated using that key.\\n  \\n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\\n  authentication using DES.\\n\\n* What exactly is DES?\\n\\n  DES is the U.S. Government\\'s Data Encryption Standard - a product \\n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \\n\\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \\n\\n* What is triple DES?\\n\\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \\n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\\n  The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\\n\\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\\n\\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\\n  \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\\n  formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\\n  Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\\n\\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\\n  single key.\"\\n\\n  Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\\n\\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\\n  its own part.)\\n\\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\\n\\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\\n\\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\\n  ciphertexts Y, Y\\' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X\\' satisfy a\\n  known difference D = X+X\\', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\\n  known plaintexts.\\n\\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\\n  improvement in the differential attack.\\n\\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.\\'\\'\\n\\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\\n\\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\\n  dictate a single wire!\\'\\' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,\\' explains Tuchman.\\'\\'\\n  \\n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\\n  Select Committee on Intelligence\\'\\', printed in the IEEE\\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.\\'\\'\\n\\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\\n  presented above.\\n\\n* Is DES available in software?\\n\\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\\n\\n  FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\\n  compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\\n\\n* Is DES available in hardware?\\n\\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\\n  We don\\'t vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\\n\\n  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES\\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\\n  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,\\n  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is\\n  214-450-0400.

Neil Schulman\\n\\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you\\'d ring up Carl Sagan,\\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n\\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n\\nA little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\nexpertise.\\n\\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n\\nHe\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\nWebster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\nof the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n\\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\\n\\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n\\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\nsentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\nfree State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\noath to support, if necessary.\"\\n\\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\nthen concluded:\\n\\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n\\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n\\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\nmaintaining a militia.\\n\\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\nand bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\nto a right of the people.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\nthat such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\nexisting, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\nshall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\nconditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\nmilitia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\nmilitia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n\\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\nauthority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\ncontrol over the military.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\nAmendment to the following sentence,\\n\\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\ninfringed.\\'\\n\\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n\\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\nand\\n\\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\nto keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\namendment in grammatical structure.\\n\\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n\\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\nany conclusion.\"\\n\\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\nprotects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n\\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\nold guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n\\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n\\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn\\'t mean what it says it means but\\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\\n\\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\\n\\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\\ncredited.

Here is some \\ninformation \"from the horse\\'s mouth\".\\n\\n(Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\"clearing\") meant to \\nbe *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying \\nthe material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)\\n\\nFrom National Telecommunications and Information Systems \\nSecurity (NTISS) \"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation \\nSecurity Guidelines\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):\\n\\n------\\n\\n\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, \\ncassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the \\nentire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be \\ncleared by applying a vendor\\'s formatting program that overwrites \\neach location with a given character.\\n\\nFixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting \\nat least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by \\napplying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each \\nlocation on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that \\nthis program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: \\nsome programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not \\nactually do this.\\n\\nCleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or \\nreleased for destruction; however, they should be marked and \\ncontrolled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of \\ninformation ever recorded.\\n\\n7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a \\ndegaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of \\nthat type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\\n\\nIf a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \\noperative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \\nemploy an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \\naddressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \\nthen its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \\nalternatively.\\n\\nWhen fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \\nthe media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two \\nalternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk \\npack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved \\ndegaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the \\nvendor\\'s facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) \\nremoved in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for \\ndestruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new \\nplatters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.\\n\\n7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\"\\n\\n[see DoD Computer Security Center, \"Department of Defense Magnetic \\nRemanence Security Guideline\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE \\nONLY]\\n\\n------\\n\\nThis and many other interesting documents (many that are more \\ninformative than probably intended) on computer security procedures \\ncan be obtained (free) from:\\n\\nExecutive Secretary\\nNational Telecommunications and Informations\\n  Systems Security Committee\\nNational Security Agency\\nFort George G.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tJohn.\\n\",\n",

If it's a choice\\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\\nthe dog first.\\n\\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\\nhas hostile intent.\\n\\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\\n\\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\\nmotorcycle is capable of.\\n\\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\\npunishment.\\n\\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\\nlearned a few tricks I think...\\n\",\n",

Timing is as follows;\\n\\n     1993 May 1-2\\n\\n        A-ring ingress  18:27\\n               egress   19:30\\n        B-ring ingress  19:51\\n               egress   21:42\\n        C-ring egress   23:00\\n        Saturn ingress  23:59\\n               egress   10:02\\n        B-ring ingress  10:28\\n               egress   12:19\\n        A-ring ingress  12:40\\n               egress   13:43\\n\\n     1993 July 20-21\\n\\n        Saturn ingress  21:16\\n               egress   05:08\\n        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)\\n               egress   09:38\\n\\nTimes could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,\\nand photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'\\norbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell\\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\\nattention.\\n\\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\\n\\nJay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:\\n\\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\\n\\n  Jay\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\\n\\njay\\n\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n\",\n",

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\\ndecade long programs.]\\n\\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\\'s idea -- Any Takers?\\n',\n",

(Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)\\n(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was\\nprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)\\n\\tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo\\npopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population is\\nruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you\\nhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism\\nof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start\\nto see for example the Andromeda\\'s bursters.\\n\\tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution\\n(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with\\nthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence\\nisotropy) and the edge is \"the edge of the Universe\" ;-)\\nIf at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)\\nand a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star\\ncolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting\\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\\n\\n\\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\\n\\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\\nthey\\'d actually probably fit relatively easily into the\\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\\n\\n   my own pet theory is that it\\'s  Flying saucers  entering\\n   hyperspace :-)\\n\\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\\n\\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...\\n\\n*  Steinn Sigurdsson   \\t\\t\\tLick Observatory      \\t*\\n*  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu\\t\\t\"standard disclaimer\"  \\t*\\n*  The laws of gravity are very,very strict\\t\\t\\t*\\n*  And you\\'re just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*\\n',\n",

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.\\n\\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\\n',\n",

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

Johnson Space Center\\n    Houston, Texas\\n\\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\\n    ==================================================================\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ---------------------------\\n\\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

When NASA\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     \\n',\n",

It\\'s a voice scrambler, nothing more.\\n\\nThere is still plenty of market for real crypto.\\n\\n> As for \"its better than the status quo\", well, first of all, you can \\n> get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today -- and they work \\n> well.\\n\\nThey cost an arm and a leg, though. \"Clipper\" is obviously aimed at the mass \\nmarket.

Example: We\\'re a networking software vendor with a \\nlarge overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even \\nsimple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department \\nof State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to \\ncompete in international information systems markets.\\n\\nSure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS\\'s in \\nthe USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be \\nthe *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to \\nhear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in \\nconfidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to \\norder products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I \\nwant to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on \\nelectronically.\\n\\nThis is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on \\ncrytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.\\n\\nClipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, \\nall the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put \\nmore restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \"good enough for \\nanyone who has nothing to hide.\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just \\nas much as \"no one needs an assault rifle\".\\n\\n\\nAmanda Walker\\nInterCon Systems Corporation\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\\n\\n\\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\\n (depending on the topic). \\n\\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\\n       list directly.\\n \\n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\\n \\n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\\n ----------------------------------\\n\\n It is possible to receive the list in \\'digest\\'ed form (ie. a\\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \\n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\\n day.\\n\\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \\n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\\n\\n\\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\\n -----------------------\\n\\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\\n\\n\\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\\n (though this isn\\'t necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\\n based mail systems). \\n\\n BOUNCES\\n -------\\n\\n Because I haven\\'t had the time (or the inclination to replace\\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\\nderived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\\nthere are only one billion possible unit keys.\\n\\n   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n   64-bit block R1:\\n\\n\\t   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n\\t   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n\\t   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n   agencies.\\n\\nHmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\\nnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\\nis an intentional way of assuring a \"fail safe\" for the government --\\nU is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\\nchange they constitute effective \"master keys\" (along with F), the\\ntheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\\ncompletely obviates the security of the system. However, more\\ninterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\\nmatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\\nand U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\\nif it NOT to provide an additional back door?\\n\\nI find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\\napproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\\nthe back of a napkin.\\n\\nEven if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\\nrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\\nassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\\ngoal is an illusion of security.\\n\\nIf S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\\nthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\\npairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\\nunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\\nsoon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\\nespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\\n-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\\nby the time we know it may be too late.\\n\\n   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\n   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\n   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\n   assurance that no information is left behind.\\n\\nNone of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\\n\"destroying the laptop\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\\nWe all know that you can\\'t read data from DRAM that has been turned\\noff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don\\'t know\\nis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\\nfirst place other than to weaken the system. We don\\'t know if the\\nagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\\ninformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\\nthe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\\nthis in a \"vault\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\\nwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\\nhigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\\nfor most of the rest of us.\\n\\n   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n   the escrow agencies.\\n\\nWhat would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\\nthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\\nhonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they\\nhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don\\'t need to\\nsteal they keys as they effectively already have them.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. \\n\\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\n',\n",

In\\n    general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three\\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\\n    special \\'servers\\'.\\n\\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\\n\\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\\n\\n    A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\\n    \\'group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\\n    called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\',\\n    and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called\\n    \\'articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\\n    posted.\\n\\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\\n    it the preferred option.\\n\\nMAILING LISTS\\n\\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\\n    in over a decade).

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\\n\\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\\nvieren de benoeming van hun \\'oervader\\' middels een breed scala\\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n\\'compacte objecten\\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\\neen apart vel.\\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\\n\\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\\ntrachten te verklaren.\\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\\n\\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim\\nin the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.\\n\\n> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\\n> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\\n> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\\n> \\n\\nI would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun-\\nications than this lot.\\n\\n> For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\n> private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\n> tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\n> protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n> the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n> law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n> industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n> \\n> Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n> protect electronic funds transfer.

While encryption\\n\\nNormmaly DES.\\n\\n> technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n> by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nNote the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this\\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use\\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife\\'s\\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The \\'unauthorized\\nrelease\\' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\\nkeys.\\n\\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\\n\\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\\nover the last decade ofr so.\\n\\n> A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n> been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNSA\\n\\n> new approach to encryption technology.\\n\\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\\n\\n>....It can be used in new,\\n> relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n> an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n> using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n> commercial use today.\\n> \\n\\nNote the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo\\nof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment\\nI suspect. Note also the \\'many\\'. not \\'all\\', as the general tone implies.\\n\\n> This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^\\n> information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n> electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n> ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n> intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nThe case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening\\nof the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms\\nis blurred yet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n> \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n> Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n> \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n> Americans.\\n\\nLets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\\nword \"ensure\". As to \\'protect\\', or \\'law-abiding\\', I will leave to you.\\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\\n\\n> ...Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n> \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n> agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n> device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n> in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n> Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n> government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n> wiretap.\\n\\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \\n\\n> The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n> new authorities to access the content of the private\\n> conversations of Americans.\\n\\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\\n\\n> To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n> Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n> devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n> government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n> the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n> their findings.\\n\\nWhere do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\\nAfter all, it is secure, isn\\'t it. The govt will answer that point by its own\\nactions.\\n\\n> The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n> encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n> privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n> criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n> approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n> to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n> to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n> trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n> the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n> comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n> \\n>      --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n>           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n                                                ^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAgain, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.\\n\\n> \\n>      --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n>           calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n                                                  ^^^^^\\n>           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\nAh, so warrents are not always needed it seems.\\n\\n> \\n>      --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n>           technology to build the National Information\\n>           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n>           the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n>           marketplace; and \\n> \\n>      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n>           high technology products.\\n\\nThe ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.\\n\\n> The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n> affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n> privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n> The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n> sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n> Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n> technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n> information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n> (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n> programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n> system transmits voice.\\n\\nNote that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the \\'proper people\\'\\nwill be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.\\n\\n> Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n> role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n> quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n> its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n> protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n> them from those who break the law.\\n\\nEncryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in\\nequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers\\nhas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no\\ndoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical\\npurposes by the middle of the next century.\\n\\n> Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n> The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n> encryption technology are also available.  \\n> \\n> For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n> Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n> \\n> ---------------------------------\\n> \\n> \\n> QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n> TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n> \\n> Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n>      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n> \\n> A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n>      no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n>      conversations of Americans.\\n> \\n> Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n>      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n>      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n>      decipher the message?\\n> \\n> A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n>      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n>      would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n>      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n>      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n>      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n>      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n>      escrow system.\\n> \\n> Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n> \\n> A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n>      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n>      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n>      oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nIt is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.\\n\\n> Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n>      how strong the security is?  \\n> \\n> A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n>      systems readily available today.\\n\\nNote we drop back to \\'phone-mode\\' again. If this is a true answer, it can be\\nrephrased as \" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench\\nwill use it for light amusement before breakfast.\"\\n\\n> ...   While the algorithm will\\n>      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n>      system,\\n\\nThis link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is \\na real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please\\nexplain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?\\n\\n> ...  we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n>      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n>      potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n>      vulnerabilities.\\n\\nJust make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.\\n\\n> \\n> Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n> \\n> A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n>      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n>      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n>      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n>      officials.\\n\\nQuick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?\\n\\n> Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n> \\n> A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n>      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n>      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n>      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n>      decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nThe people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.\\n\\n> Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n> \\n> A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n>      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n>      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n>      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n>      manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nThe reverse engineering provisions of the \\'Mask-work\\' act could be relevent\\nhere.\\n\\n> Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n> \\n> A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n>      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n>      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n>      to other vendors in the future.\\n> \\n> Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n> \\n> A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n>      the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n\\nYou don\\'t. Not unless you are one of the \\'right people\\'.\\n\\n> Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n>      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n>      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n>      powerful encryption devices?\\n> \\n> A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n>      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n\\nThey missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.\\n\\n>      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n>      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n>      than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n>      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n>      encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n>      developing.\\n\\nI would say \"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ),\\nless available, and more prone to being comprimised\"\\nProofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.\\n\\n>      The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n>      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n>      we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n>      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n>      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n>      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal\\nDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit\\nreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don\\'t think that the\\nMexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous\\ngesture.\\n\\n> ...  There is a\\n>      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n>      an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n>      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n>      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n>      Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nThe \\'false tension\\' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The\\nRIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false\\nassessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps\\nYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined\\nin the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don\\'t agree, you must be a\\ncriminal, as only criminals don\\'t agree with out laws. Also note the non-\\nquestion. \"If what is here was not possible...\"\\n\\n> Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n>      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n>      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n> \\n> A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n>      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n>      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n>      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n>      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n>      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n>      and terrorism.\\n\\nIt indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert\\nsuitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of\\nfreedom and ultra-national sentiment.\\n\\n> Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n>      the government hardware?\\n> \\n> A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n>      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n>      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n>      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n>      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n>      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n>      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n>      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n>      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n>      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n>      of these products.\\n> \\n\\nThis one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the\\nkeys, and the algorithm. Don\\'t think it\\'s at the top of my list of things I must\\nhave, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill\\nof crock.\\n\\nAny for any others using it, they must be nuts!\\n\\nGood luck folks.\\n\\n~Paul\\n\\n',\n",

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\\n\\n    If you don\\'t want to see the FAQ, add \\'Frequently Asked Questions\\' to\\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\\'re not reading this with a newsreader\\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\\'re out of luck).\\n\\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\\n\\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\\n\\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\\n\\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\\n\\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\\n    discussion.\\n\\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\\n\\n    Hope you aren\\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\\n\\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\\n\\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\\n    FAQ postings.\\n\\n\\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\\n\\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\\'re on Usenet.\\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you\\'re taking a tangent.\\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\\n\\t100 posts).\\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\\n\\tnot SPACE.\\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\\n\\treferences.)\\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\\'re\\n\\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\\n\\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don\\'t assume the\\n\\t\\'reply\\' function of mailers will work.\\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\\'t post what everyone\\n\\twill get on TV anyway.\\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\\n\\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\\n\\t(use carriage returns).\\n\\n\\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\\n\\n    I\\'ve attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn\\'t\\n    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each\\n    posting.

I think that it\\'s not a bad idea to\\nbring the idea up, but it\\'s best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first\\nlesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry\\nabout proper handlebar technique.\\n\\n>countersteering.  In fact, my Experienced Rider Course instructors\\n>claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike\\n>turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight\\n>around, even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite\\n>direction.  (I admit I\\'ve never actually seen this.)\\n\\nI have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during\\nthe lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student\\nwould take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the\\n\"you are a sack of potatoes\" passenger speech, the instructor would steer\\nthe bike and make a general nuisance of himself.

In addition, many stand alone\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\n\\n\\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\\n\\n\\tEndeavour\\'s June flight and Discovery\\'s July mission both will include\\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\\nHuntsville, Ala.\\n\\n\\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\\ntrainers.\\n\\n\\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\\n\\n\\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\\nbecome necessary.\\n\\n- end -\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     \\n-- \\n\\tJim Gillogly\\n\\tTrewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01\\n',\n",

On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\\n\\n6.

I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\\n>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today\\'s standards,\\n>marginal.\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.

Big deal.\\n>Let\\'s be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n>isn\\'t done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When \\n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.

I suspect that NSA\\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.

However, even if more intelligent schemes are used\\nto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-\\nnesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would\\ntrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for\\n(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the\\ncomplaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars\\nto build a keysearch machine for.)\\n \\n   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of\\nthe GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?

Anybody know?\\n\\nI don\\'t know, but I\\'m as willing to speculate as anyone.\\n\\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit into\\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\\n\\nHal Finney\\n',\n",

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\\n\\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\\nand giving up 6.6/game. \\n\\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \\nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\\nis a big question mark.\\n\\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

The new cryptography scheme was\\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\\n\\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA\\'s role in the creation of\\nsuch standards.\\n\\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\\ndeveloping the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\\nDSS.\\n\\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\\nadministration\\'s apparent commitment to the privacy of\\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today\\'s official\\nstatement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\\nthe propriety of NSA\\'s role in the process and the apparent\\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\\npublic scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\\nestablished openly and with full public participation.  It is\\nnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\\nsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\\nplay a leading role in the development process.\"\\n\\n        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\\nindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\\ntechnology on society.

Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\\n\\n        The unit key \\n\\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\n\\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\n\\nThe unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\nserial number N as follows.

In 1985\\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\\nthem.\\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \"There are a lot of\\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\\nsignals intelligence operation of this group.\"\\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\\nonly increase their numbers.\\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\\nand civil liberties questions involved.\\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\\nan investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people.  I\\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\\nconviction rate high.\\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\\n(even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is\\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\\nvote for morality.\\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\\n     To most of the American public, the word \"hacker\" has\\nrightly or wrongly come to mean \"high tech adolescent vandal\".\\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\\nsurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does\\nnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I\\nwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead\\nAct.\\n     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming\\nat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,\\nand just as IBM is learning that they can\\'t do business the same\\nway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should\\nevaluate another approach.\\n     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic\\nstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out\\nregarding the constitutional issues involved.\\n     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.\\n     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela\\nvous concerne, cheri?\\n',\n",

Even when the\\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n',\n",

I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n                                  ----------------------------------- \\nAndy Jonathan J.

       "  \"From: brands@cwi.nl (Stefan Brands)\\nSubject: * REPORT ON PRIVACY-PROTECTING OFF-LINE CASH AVAILABLE *\\nOrganization: CWI, Amsterdam\\nLines: 60\\n\\nI recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash\\nsystem as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David\\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\\n\\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\\nretrieved from\\n\\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\\n\\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\\n\\n====================================================================\\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\\nproposed previously.\\n  \\nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \\n  \\nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\\nretaining its computational efficiency.\\n====================================================================\\n\\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \\n\\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\\npossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\\nme and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also\\nwelcome!\\n\\nStefan Brands, \\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nCWI, Kruislaan 413, 1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands \\nTel: +31 20 5924103, e-mail: brands@cwi.nl  \\n\",\n",

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\\n \\nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n \\nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\\n \\nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\\nhand!\\n\\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\\nAmerican.  Let\\'s go fly it!\\n',\n",

Private industry has a better standard,\\nbut it\\'s not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market\\nwith cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry\\'s technology is better,\\nthe programming is being broadcast to the govt\\'s unduplicatable standard.\\nWho could compete?\\n\\n  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures\\nthat it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license\\nlast week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN\\nCARD to veryify the number!  Note that a federal law once said that no state\\nor local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration\\n(specifically!).\\n\\n   I do not trust the govt that says \"trust me on this even though we could\\nhave an arrangement that doesn\\'t require your trust.\"  Something is big\\ntime fishy. If you look more carefully, you\\'ll see it.\\n\\n  -mel\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________\\n| Mel beckman                  |   Internet: mbeckman@mbeckman.com     |\\n| Beckman Software Engineering | Compuserve: 75226,2257                |\\n| Ventura, CA 93003            |  Voice/fax: 805/647-1641 805/647-3125 |\\n|______________________________|_______________________________________|\\n \"You can observe a lot just by watching.\"  -Yogi Bera\\n',\n",

Helsingius?\\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n\\nIDENTITY\\n========\\n\\n_____\\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\\n\\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\\n\\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\\n\\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\\n\\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\\n\\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\\n\\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \\n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \\n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\\n\\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\\n\\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\\n  order that new users are added to the system.\\n\\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\\n  computer receiving mail.\\n\\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\\n\\n  Common Suffixes\\n  ---------------\\n\\n  .us    United States\\n  .uk    United Kingdom\\n  .ca    Canada\\n  .fi    Finland\\n  .au    Australia\\n\\n  .edu   university or college\\n  .com   commercial organization\\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\\n  .gov   government\\n  .mil   military site\\n \\n_____\\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\\n\\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\\n\\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\\n\\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\\n\\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\\n\\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\\n  \\n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\\n  \\n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\\n  \\n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\\n\\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \\n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\\n\\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \\n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \\n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\\n\\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\\n  individual.  \\n  \\n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\\n    in the From: line.\\n  \\n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \\n\\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\\n    hackers.\\n    \\n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\\n  on the internet:\\n\\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\\n  \\n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\\n  \\n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \\n  \\n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\\n    interpretations at different sites.\\n  \\n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\\n\\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\\n  in privacy.\\n\\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\\n\\n\\nPRIVACY\\n=======\\n\\n_____\\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\\n\\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \\n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\\n\\n_____\\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\\n\\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\\n  discourages its regulation.\\n\\n_____\\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\\n\\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\\n  \\n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\\n    possible.\\n  \\n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\\n    prohibitive for casual use.\\n\\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\\n    \\n_____\\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\\n\\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \\n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\\n  without detection.\\n\\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \\n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\\n  \\n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\\n  \\n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\\n  various reasons:\\n  \\n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\\n    someone else. \\n\\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\\n    many weeks. \\n\\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \\n\\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\\n    ones.\\n\\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\\n\\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\\n\\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\\n  - Make sure to logout always.\\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\\n  - Avoid password references in email.\\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\\n    considerate.\\n\\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \\n  passwords.\\n\\n\\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\\n  here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\\n\\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \\n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\\n \\n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\\n\\n  Examples\\n  --------\\n\\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\\n\\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\\n  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\\n  is completely invisible to them.\\n\\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\\n    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\\n    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\\n    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\\n\\n  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\\n  from `group' and `other'. \\n  \\n  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\\n  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\\n  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\\n  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\\n  is possible:\\n\\n    ls foo\\n\\n  These commands would fail independent of file rights:\\n  \\n    ls -l foo\\n    ls -l foo/file\\n    cat foo/file\\n    cd foo\\n\\n  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\\n  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\\n  readable file named `file':\\n  \\n    ls -l foo/file\\n    cat foo/file\\n    cd foo\\n  \\n  The following commands fail:\\n  \\n    ls foo\\n    ls -l foo\\n  \\n\\n  (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\\n\\n  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\\n  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\\n  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\\n  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \\n  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\\n  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\\n  machine as the server.\\n\\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\\n  Windows.\\n\\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\\n  \\n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \\n  \\n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \\n\\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \\n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \\n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\\n  is extremely complex.\\n\\n\\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \\n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\\n\\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\\n\\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\\n    such as a university. \\n  \\n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\\n    tested legally.\\n\\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\\n    other than the recipient.\\n\\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\\n    overridden.\\n\\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \\n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \\n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\\n\\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\\n  policies.''\\n\\n_____\\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\\n\\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \\n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\\n\\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\\n  unpopular opinions.)\\n  \\n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\\n\\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \\n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\\n\\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\\n    files\\n\\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\\n  guidelines:\\n\\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\\n    communication.\\n  - Use a disclaimer.\\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\\n    proprietary or `internal'.\\n\\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\\n\\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\\n  ---\\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\\n\\n  /pub/academic/cases\\n  ---\\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\\n    description of the items in the directory.\\n\\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\\n  ---\\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\\n\\n_____\\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\\n\\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \\n  \\n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\\n    `passwd -f').\\n   \\n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \\n    \\n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\\n    \\n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\\n    \\n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\\n    in your home directory.\\n    \\n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \\n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\\n\\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\\n  below.\\n\\n______\\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\\n\\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\\n  extremely strict.\\n\\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\\n  which can potentially be misused.\\n\\n______\\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\\n\\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\\n\\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\\n\\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\\n  \\n______\\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\\n\\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\\n  the internet.\\n  \\n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\\n\\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\\n  unstoppable.\\n  \\n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\\n  years.\\n\\n\\nANONYMITY\\n=========\\n\\n_____\\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\\n\\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \\n  \\n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \\n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \\n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\\n\\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\\n\\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\\n  assurances of anonymity.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\\n\\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\\n\\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\\n\\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\\n  for the same person for different machine address email\\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \\n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\\n  mentioned above.\\n\\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \\n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \\n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \\n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\\n\\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\\n  \\n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\\n    implemented yet.\\n\\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\\n\\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\\n  \\n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\\n    that goes through them.\\n\\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \\n\\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\\n    regarding it as illicit use. \\n\\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\\n    server operator by the user.\\n\\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\\n\\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \\n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\\n\\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \\n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\\n  before proceeding.\\n\\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\\n  consequences can ensue.\\n\\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \\n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\\n\\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \\n  \\n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\\n    return addresses. \\n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\\n    unaltered. \\n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\\n    to a remailer are common.\\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\\n    the use of passwords.\\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\\n  \\n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\\n  \\n_____\\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\\n\\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\\n  \\n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \\n\\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\\n  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\\n  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\\n  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\\n  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\\n  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\\n  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\\n  acceptance of Usenet.\\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThis is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ, obtained via anonymous\\n  FTP to pit-manager@mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy/ or \\n  newsgroups news.answers, sci.answers, alt.answers every 21 days.\\nWritten by L.

Well, for these guys, splitfires\\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren\\'t focusing\\non horsepower numbers.\\n\\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\\nbut 4\\'s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\\nSo for 4\\'s, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\\n\\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\\nor anything made, just stick \\'em in.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t know about all of this (and I\\'m trying to catch up with\\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\\n4\\'s.        \\n\\nAs far as racing teams....

The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n* What's RSA?\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\\n  and Hellman in 1976.\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\\n\\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\\n\\n* What's RSA?\\n\\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\\n\\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\\n\\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\\n\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n\\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\\n  results.''\\n\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n\\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\\n  any case.\\n\\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\\n\\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\\n\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.\\n  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which\\n  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be\\n  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want\\n  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the\\n  books and journal articles listed in part 10.\\n\",\n",
